Pariemacs
========

Pariemacs consists of major modes for hacking libpari and GP scripts
in Emacs, written and maintained by Olivier Ramar√©[1].  This
repository contains my personal additions, many of which will likely
be incorporated upstream in due course.  The [upstream
branch](https://github.com/mhsiah/pariemacs/tree/upstream) mirrors
Olivier's code; the [master
branch](https://github.com/mhsiah/pariemacs/tree/master) includes my
changes.
